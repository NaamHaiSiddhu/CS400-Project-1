John saw a bee on the ceiling in his room. He was petrified of insects but he was against the idea of taking a life 
just because he was repulsed by it. Unfortunatefly for John, the bee was on the ceiling just above his bed and he didn't 
have the courage to go to sleep so he rolled a newspaper and swatted it out of his room. The bee buzzed on the floor and  
tried to get back into his room so John lunged out, who was standing at the doorstep, lunged out and swatted the bee away.
Only thing was- he forgot his keys and the doors slammed shut.

Locked out of his room, John was at a loss of what to do. He was in his pajamas, and felt a bit embarassed. After looking at signs
in the hallway, he decided to call his RA. Luckily, his RA was awake, and had a master key for his room. After a quick chat with 
the RA, and a minute to get the key, John was back in his room.
