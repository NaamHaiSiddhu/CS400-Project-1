John saw a bee on the ceiling in his room. He was petrified of insects but he was against the idea of taking a life just because he was repulsed by it. Unfortunatefly for John, the bee was on the ceiling just above his bed and he didn't have the courage to go to sleep so he rolled a newspaper and swatted it out of his room. The bee buzzed on the floor and  tried to get back into his room so John lunged out, who was standing at the doorstep, lunged out and swatted the bee away.Only thing was- he forgot his keys and the doors slammed shut.
